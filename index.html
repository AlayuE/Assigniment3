                    regular, incremental progress over a long period of time. In other words, it requires strong habits! <br>This course 
                    will help you to narrow down your goals (especially helpful if you have a lot), break the ones you’re focusing on 
                    down into actionable habits, <br>and stick to those habits by combining self-discipline with smart external tools and systems.<br>

                run the gamut from study tips, to sleep science, to internship and career preparation.

                 scientists, entrepreneurs, and other interesting people – including Gary Vaynerchuk, Cal Newport, and Gretchen Rubin.

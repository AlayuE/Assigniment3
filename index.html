                            expert advice on career-related topics. I read a lot and consult recruiting professionals so 
                            you don’t have to. I show you how to hack the recruitment process, create a job-winning resume, 
                            ace the job interview, and... introduce yourself, among others.My name’s John. I’ve just joined 
                            the marketing department as an outreach specialist.I’ll be getting in touch with influencers, bloggers, 
                            and vloggers to increase our online presence.If you see a new face around, well, that’s me:) We can
                             chat about cyberpunk literature, video games,and downhill mountain biking.I am currently in my second year 
                             of my Early Childhood Study’s Degree. I am 19 years old and live in large family of 5 siblings. I have
                              previously studied psychology and health and social care as my A-levels and throughout my years of learning
                               I can honestly put forward that knowledge can always be captured no matter what the profession, there is no
                                such thing as too much knowledge. In addition, I am extremely grateful to have gained all my experiences 
                                and skills and will always keep an eye out for new opportunities.In the beginning of my academic year I 
                                witnessed a major difference between the learning environment, this is mainly because I transitioned through
                                 a 6 form college where the environment was more controlled and students were less independent. 
                                 University to me in comparison to college, felt more independent and relaxed, however although in 
                                 the beginning I was quite frightened by the change of environment and people, with the help of the staff 
                                 I managed to make new friends from all age groups. This enabled me to share my experience as well as gain
                                  an insight into other individuals experiences.

                    regular, incremental progress over a long period of time. In other words, it requires strong habits! <br>This course 
                    will help you to narrow down your goals (especially helpful if you have a lot), break the ones you’re focusing on 
                    down into actionable habits, <br>and stick to those habits by combining self-discipline with smart external tools and systems.<br>

                However, because of my commitment to spending the majority of my time working deeply, and because of the volume of email I already receive, email isn’t the best way to contact me if you have a question or are reaching out for something that isn’t business-related.
